# Translation Widget – End‑User Guide (English)

This guide explains how translators can use the on‑page widget to translate website content quickly and safely.

## Showing the widget

- Click the floating Translate button, or
- Press Shift+Space

When the widget is visible, interactive elements (links, buttons) are made safe to click so you can open the edit modal without navigating away.

## Translating text (most common workflow)

1. Ensure “Preview Mode” is ON.
2. Click any text on the page (heading, paragraph, button, link, table cell, etc.).
3. In the pop-up:
   - Review the Original text.
   - Enter your Translation.
   - Optionally add an Extra note for reviewers.
  - Optionally check “Mark this text for removal” if you want the text to be deleted.
4. Save your work (Save button or Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter).
5. The translation applies immediately on the page (if preview is on).

Tip: Use “Show Untranslated Borders” to see blue dashed borders around content that hasn’t been translated yet.

## Adding a custom translation

Use “Add Custom” to store a translation for text that doesn’t (yet) appear on the page.

1. Click “Add Custom”.
2. Enter Original Text (exact source string) and its Translation.
3. Save. The translation is stored locally and included in exports.

## Importing and exporting

- Export JSON: Downloads a file containing all translations.
- Import JSON: Loads translations from a JSON file. If Preview Mode is ON, the page updates immediately. (Use this if you want to import translations into another browser, or if your browser lost them.)
- Export HTML: Downloads a human‑readable HTML report of all current translations.

## Clearing all translations

If needed, click “Clear translations”. You must type `CONFIRM` to proceed. This removes all local translations and reloads the page. After this, you can only access previously translated content by importing it again (if you downloaded the JSON beforehand).

## Keyboard shortcuts

- Shift+Space – Toggle widget visibility
- Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter) – Save in dialogs
- Esc – Cancel/Close dialogs

## Tips

- Keep Preview Mode ON while translating so you can see the results instantly.
- Use Extra notes to give context to reviewers or to yourself later.
- “Mark for removal” is a flag to indicate the original text should be deleted by developers/content owners.
 - It’s recommended to frequently show and hide the widget to more easily translate hidden content on the page.

## Troubleshooting

- I click text but nothing happens: Make sure the widget is visible and no dialog is already open.
- My click opens a link: Ensure the widget is visible; when visible, links/buttons are disabled and safe to click for editing.
